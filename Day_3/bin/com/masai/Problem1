A)The code will not execute it will throw compile time error.
 if a  class is extending an abstract class ,then the must child class must be implemented ot mark the child

 so the code will throw an error
 
 B)The code will  execute .
 if a  class is extending an abstract class ,then the must child class must be implemented or mark the child 
 class as abstract class.Here the child has  marked as abstract class
 
 C)the abstract class can have private variables and private method but when e extends this abstract class
 we cannot use this variable or method.
 
 D)Even though the abstract class have private variable we can access it through the getter and setter methods
