1)the code will execute an interface can be extended by another interface
Also interface can achieve multiple inheritance in java


2)This code will throw compile time error 
An interface can only be extended by another interface and not implements
  An interface can only be implements with the class

 3)This code will throw compile time error 
An interface can only be extended by another interface and not implements
  An interface can only be implements with the class
  
4)This code will execute
   A class can  implements  another interface then the class must be marked as abstract class or the unimplemented
   method in the interface should be implemented inside the class
   
5)This code will execute
   By default the variables and methods in the interface is public,static,final and we cannot change it
   
6)This code will execute
   By default the variables and methods in the interface is public,static,final and we cannot change it.
   We can initialize the value, by default the value is zero
   
7)This code will execute
From java 8 onward normal methods are possible in java ,but the method should be marked as default or static
 It is not mandatory to override this method in the child class 
 
8)This code will throw compile time error 
  Because we cant call the unimplement method with the child object
  
9)This code will execute
  output will be "override"
