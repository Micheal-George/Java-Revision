subclass implicitly call even default constructor present in super class which is non parameterised.
 We have to call explicitly when we pass parameters to the constructor.
 
 In this example while we are creating labardor object which is extended from dog class ,dog class extends animal class
 when we are creating labardor object with zero arguement constructor , the constructor method will call its
 super class which is dog(subclass implicitly call even default constructor present in super class),dog class
 constructor method will call its super class which is animal class.
 Then the following output will be printed
 Animal Constructor
Dog Constructor
Labrador Constructor
