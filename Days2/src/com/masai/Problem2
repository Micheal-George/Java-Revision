A)
An Interface contains  abstract method and constant variables .All the methods and variables inside 
the interface s public,static,final by default we cant change it.
in this problem in line number private access modifier is used so it will lead to compile time error  

B)
this code will not give an error
this is default method inside the interface
If we want to add a new function in an Interface we have to use default method inside the interface
 It is not madatory to override default method of an interface inside implementation class
